In this practical, we worked on creating and managing Pluggable Databases (PDBs) using Oracle Database.
In task 1: Successfully created a new PDB named ch_pdb_27800 and a user account chela_plsqlauca_27800.
In task 2: Created another PDB ch_to_delete_pdb_27800, verified it, and then deleted it successfully.
Task 3: Could not be completed because we used Oracle AI 23, which does not support Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM).
During the setup process, we faced challenges downloading Oracle 21c for Windows and SQL Developer. We resolved this by switching to Oracle AI 23, which installed successfully but lacked OEM.
